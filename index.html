         Shared autonomy is an operational concept in which a user and an autonomous agent collaboratively control a robotic system.
         It provides a number of advantages over the extremes of full-teleoperation and full-autonomy in many settings.
         Traditional approaches to shared autonomy rely on knowledge of the environment dynamics,
         a discrete space of user goals that is known a priori, or knowledge of the user's policy---assumptions that are unrealistic in many domains.
         Recent works relax these assumptions by formulating shared autonomy with model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL), and train the agent's policy that produces an action close to that of the user while satisfying value function constraints.
         These formulations inherently rely on human-in-the-loop training to learn the assistant's policy and, in practice, replace the user with a surrogate policy for the sake of training efficiency.
         In effect, this trades one difficulty for another. While we no longer need knowledge of the goal space (e.g., that the goals are discrete or constrained), we do need knowledge of  a task-specific reward function to train the policy. Unfortunately, such reward specification can be a difficult and brittle process.
         In this paper, we present a new approach to shared autonomy that employs a modulation of the forward and reverse diffusion process of diffusion models.
         Our approach does not assume known environment dynamics or the space of user goals, and in contrast to previous work,
         it does not require any reward feedback, nor does it require access to the user's policy (surrogate or otherwise) during training.
         Instead, our framework learns a distribution over a potentially multimodal space of desired behaviors.

         we show that it is possible to carry out this process in a manner that preserves the user's control authority.

         user actions while maintaining their autonomy.

    <h2 id="what-is-shared-autonomy">What is shared autonomy?</h2>
        <p>
            Shared autonomy considers a setting where a user and an assistive agent work together to control a robotic system. <br />
            Shared autonomy is particularly beneficial in settings in which the task may be difficult or even impossible for the user to perform on their own (e.g., flying a high-agility aircraft). The goal of the assistive agent is to improve the user's ability to perform the task (e.g., by avoiding crashes), and the challenge is to do so while simultaneously preserving their intent (e.g., landing at the appropriate destination).
        </p>

    <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Once trained, diffusion models can pull <strong>a noisy sample</strong> back to the <strong>training data manifold</strong>.
            More accurately, diffusion models learn a gradient field, where a vector at each location points toward higher likelihood region in the training data distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the same way, when a diffusion model is trained on expert demonstrations (state-conditioned actions),
            it should be able to pull <strong>a noisy action</strong> closer to the <strong>expert action manifold</strong>.
        </p>
        <!-- <img src="./media/gradient-field4.png"> -->
        <p>
            Now, let us consider shared autonomy setting.
            A user produces a suboptimal action \(a^h_t\), and our assistive agent needs to correct it.
            If we pretend that the action \(a^h_t\) is <strong>the noisy action</strong>,
            the pretrained diffusion model will correct the action to make it look more like an expert action.
            <!-- <img src="./media/motivation2.png" alt="motivation" class="center-narrow"> -->
        </p>
        <p>
            This achieves <i>assisting</i> the user by correcting its action.
            <!-- This is exactly what we want. <br \> -->
            Diffusion model trained on expert demonstrations should be able to serve as an assistive agent!
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="method">Method</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            A standard diffusion model runs the reverse diffusion (i.e., denoising) process from Gaussian distribution to generate a sample.
            Sampling from Gaussian distribution is equivalent to applying the forward diffusion (i.e., noising) process to an arbitrary sample.
            Thus, this standard generation procedure can be seen as applying the forward and then reverse diffusion process to a sample.
        </p>
        <p>
            We consider applying the forward diffusion process on the user action <strong>partially</strong> (quantified via the <i>forward diffusion ratio</i> \(\gamma\)),
            followed by the reverse diffusion process for the same number of steps.
            The property of generated action changes according to \(\gamma\):
            <!-- In this procedure, \(k\) controls the trade-off between -->
            <!-- This amounts to adding Gaussian noise to the user action iteratively. -->
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When \(\gamma\) is small, the resulting action is close to the user action (i.e., high fidelity to user's intention) </li>
            <li>When \(\gamma\) is large, the resulting action has high likelihood in expert distribution (i.e., high conformity to expert)</li>
        </ul>


        With a diffusion model pretrained on expert demonstrations (state-conditioned actions),
        we apply this partial diffusion procedure on the user action \(a^h_t\) to generate a corrected shared action \(a^s_t\).

    <h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
    <p>
        We evaluate our algorithm in four shared autonomy environments including a (a) 2D Control task in
        which an agent navigates to one of two different goals, (b) Lunar Lander that tasks a drone with
        landing at a designated location, (c) a Lunar Reacher variant in which the objective is to reach a
        designated region in the environment, and (d) Block Pushing, in which the objective is to use a robot
        arm to push an object into one of two different goal regions.

    <p>
        The following plots show success rate vs forward diffusion ratio \(\gamma\)
        for noisy expert. The dashed blue lines denote the success rates of
        the original expert, while the dotted blue lines are the success rate of our model with
        <i>full</i> diffusion (i.e., \(\gamma = 1.0\) ).

    <p>
        Following is the statistics information for three environments about different pilots with and without assistance,
        where we show the results for our chosen value \(\gamma = 0.4\) for Lunar Lander and Lunar Reacher and \(\gamma = 0.2\)
        for Block Pushing.
        Each entry corresponds to \(10\) episodes across \(30\) random seeds.
